Q. Binary Tree Nodes

  You are given a table, BST, containing two columns: N and P, where N represents the value of a node in Binary Tree, and P is the parent of N.

  Write a query to find the node type of Binary Tree ordered by the value of the node. Output one of the following for each node:

  Root: If node is root node.
  Leaf: If node is leaf node.
  Inner: If node is neither root nor leaf node.
  Sample Input

  Sample Output

  1 Leaf
  2 Inner
  3 Leaf
  5 Root
  6 Leaf
  8 Inner
  9 Leaf

A. 
  select distinct(num), 
      case
          when jo is null then 'Root'
          when jo2 is null then 'Leaf'
          else 'Inner'
      end
  from (
      select a.n as num, a.p as jo, b.n as jo2, b.p
      from bst a
      full outer join bst b
      on a.n = b.p)
  where num is not null
  order by num;
